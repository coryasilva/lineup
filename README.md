## About

This was created for the Vista Red Wings &mdash; a [Special Olympics of Southern California](https://www.specialolympics.org/Regions/north-america/Locations/Special-Olympics-NA-California-South.aspx) floor hockey team. During tournaments the lineups are due 15 minutes before game start but many times the olympians have transportation or other issues and last minute changes must be made.  This is a tedious and sometimes difficult process.
